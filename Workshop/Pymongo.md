### Creating an environtment in python 3

First we must access to our visual studio or any editor with terminal to make things easier for us. Now let's create a folder with the name `My mongo db`. We access it by means of the terminal, where we will execute: 

`pip3 install virtualenv`

With this we will be installing the library to be able to create environments with python. As a second step we will execute the following command to generate the environment.

`virtualenv ambiente -p python3`
